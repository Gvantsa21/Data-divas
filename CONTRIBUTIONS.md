# Team Member Contributions

Our team worked together closely on every part of this project. Everyone contributed to coding, testing, and improving each other's work before uploading anything to GitHub. We regularly reviewed each other's code, suggested changes, fixed bugs, and made sure everything worked smoothly.

## Ani Kharabadze
- Focused on **Machine Learning**:
  - Built Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models to predict track popularity.
  - Did feature selection, scaling, train-test splitting, and evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores.
- Helped improve **code readability** by adding comments, docstrings, and organizing functions.
- Checked Mariam and Gvantsa’s work, helped debug, and suggested optimizations.
- Contributed to documenting the **ML process and results** in the README.

## Mariam Phirtskhalava
- Worked mainly on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and creating visualizations:
  - Made scatter plots, violin plots, distribution plots and created an **interactive chart** with the help of group members to better understand the data.
- Created **derived features** like `acousticness`, `valence_category`, and `tempo_category` to help with analysis.
- Helped with **outlier analysis**, calculating statistics, and checking correlations between features.
- Reviewed and tested Ani and Gvantsa’s code, suggested improvements, and made fixes together.

## Gvantsa Tchuradze
- Led the **data preprocessing and cleaning**:
  - Handled missing values, capped outliers with the help of group members using the IQR method, and optimized data types.
  - Created derived features like `duration_min`, `energy_dance_ratio`, `is_instrumental`, and `is_acoustic`.
- Set up the **GitHub structure** and made sure all files were well organized.
- Helped review and fix ML and visualization code, making improvements where needed.
- Worked with the team on final **results summary and presentation prep**.

## Collaborative Work
- We constantly **worked on each other's code**, suggesting improvements, fixing errors, and testing changes together.
- Every feature, preprocessing step, and ML model was **peer-reviewed** before uploading to GitHub.
- We discussed problems and solved bugs **together**, making sure the project stayed on track.
- We all contributed to **final documentation**, making it clear and complete for anyone reviewing the project.
